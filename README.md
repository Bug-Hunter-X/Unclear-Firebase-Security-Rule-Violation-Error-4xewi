This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Firebase's Realtime Database. The issue stems from a lack of clarity in error messages when security rules are violated. The provided code shows a scenario where a write operation fails due to rules, but the error message isn't informative enough for developers to pinpoint the problem. The solution offers improved error handling using Promises to provide more detailed feedback.
