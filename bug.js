The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to Firebase's Realtime Database rules and client-side security.  The error arises when a client attempts to write data that violates the security rules, but the error message is not descriptive enough for the developer to quickly understand the issue.  This is due to asynchronous nature of Firebase database operations.
