The solution uses Promises and a more structured `catch` block to capture and handle the specific error from the database write operation.  The error object from the Firebase API provides more detailed information about the rule violation, aiding in debugging. This improved error handling provides developers with the necessary context to quickly identify and rectify the issue.
